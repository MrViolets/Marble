Like marbles, tabs are unique on their own but are better in collections. This Google Chrome extension will automatically group your tabs by domain.

## Install

1. Download and uncompress zip.
2. In Chrome, go to the extensions page at `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable Developer Mode.
4. Choose `Load Unpacked` and select the folder.

## Build

1. `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Update `version` in `manifest.json`.
3. `npm run build`.

## Usage

Once installed, your tabs will be grouped according to the web domain/hostname. Any new tabs created will also be automatically grouped. Click the extension icon to access preferences.
